"""
We simulate objects in the sky
Each object has following characteristics

- position (ra, dec) : ra uniform on [-90.0, 90.0], dec uniform on [0.0, 90.0]
- intrinsic intensity : uniform on [1, 1000.0]
- intrinsic color : uniform on [1 .. 6]
- red shift : uniform on [0.0 .. 3.0]

- I0 = 500.0
- effective luminosity: f(intensity, redshift) : el = log(I/I0) * z

We can construct the image for an object

Gaussian pattern at position. Pixels are filled up to some threshold

Then we fill the image from simulated objects


- rasize = 180.0 / 100
- decsize = 90.0 / 100

We find all objects
